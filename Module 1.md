## **1.1 What is Cloud Computing?**

**Definition:**  
Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery of IT resources** over the internet with **pay-as-you-go pricing**. Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, organizations can access technology services such as computing power, storage, and databases on a need basis from a cloud provider.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **On-Demand Self-Service**
    
- **Broad Network Access**
    
- **Resource Pooling**
    
- **Rapid Elasticity**
    
- **Measured Service**

## **1.2 Evolution and History of Cloud Computing**

- **1960s:** Concept of time-sharing on mainframes (John McCarthy envisioned computing as a public utility).
    
- **1990s:** Emergence of virtualization and grid computing.
    
- **2006:** Amazon launched **AWS EC2 & S3**, marking the beginning of modern cloud services.
    
- **2010s – Present:** Widespread adoption by enterprises; rise of hybrid, multi-cloud, and edge computing.
